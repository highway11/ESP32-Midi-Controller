# ESP32-Midi-Controller
Midi Controller with Expression Pedal
This controller was built to control VST plugins in Reaper.

This branch uses multiple OLED screens using a [TCA9548A multiplexer](https://www.amazon.ca/gp/product/B08DY5VXZ3/)

I also switched from using RTPMidi to using [Hairless Midi](https://projectgus.github.io/hairless-midiserial/) which is MIDI over Usb/Serial
