# ESP32-Midi-Controller (Single OLED Version)
Midi Controller with Expression Pedal<br/>
This controller was built to control VST plugins in Reaper.<br/>
It uses an ESP32, 10 footswitches, 1 expression pedal.<br/>
It connects to the computer running the DAW via the RTPMidi protocol.</br>

Note: This branch is an older version of my controller. I've since updated it with support for multiple OLED screens and switched from wireless RTPMidi to Midi over serial/usb. Please check the other branches in this repository for those versions. I'm keeping this branch as some may prefer the wireless RTPMidi and to only use one OLED screen.
