# ESP32-Midi-Controller
Midi Controller with Expression Pedal using RTPMidi over wifi
This controller was built to control VST plugins in Reaper.
It uses an ESP32, 10 footswitches, 1 expression pedal. 
It connects to the computer running the DAW via the RTPMidi protocol.

Note: This branch is an older version of my controller. I've since updated it with support for multiple OLED screens and switched from wireless RTPMidi to Midi over serial/usb. Please check the other branches in this repository for those versions. I'm keeping this branch as some may prefer the wireless RTPMidi and to only use one OLED screen.
